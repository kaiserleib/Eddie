# Eddie - Future Ideas

## More Instruments

- Add a drum track with a simple grid (kick, snare, hi-hat, crash)
- Bass guitar track (4 strings, lower octave)
- Piano roll view as an alternative to tab notation
- Let tracks be muted/solo'd independently

## Better Sound

- Sample-based playback instead of oscillators (record real guitar samples)
- Effects chain: reverb, delay, distortion
- Per-track volume/panning
- Envelope shaping for pluck vs sustain sounds

## Composition Helpers

- "Suggest next chord" based on music theory
- Auto-harmonize: enter a melody, generate chord accompaniment
- Song sections (intro/verse/chorus/bridge) with arrangement timeline
- Pattern copy/paste between positions
- Undo/redo

## Learning Mode

- Display chord names above the tab as you compose
- Highlight scale degrees (root, third, fifth)
- Show fingering diagrams for chords
- Practice mode: slow tempo that gradually speeds up

## Visual/Game Modes

- Audio visualizer synced to playback (waveform, frequency bars)
- "Guitar Hero" scrolling view during playback
- Mood/scene generator: pick "battle", "peaceful", "mysterious" and generate appropriate music

## Different Tunings/Instruments

- Alternate tunings (Drop D, DADGAD, Open G)
- Ukulele mode (4 strings, different tuning)
- Mandolin, banjo presets

## Generative/AI

- Style presets: blues, folk, metal, classical
- "Continue this" - generate more bars matching your style
- Counterpoint generator: write one melody, get a complementary second voice

## Collaboration

- Song library with community submissions
- "Remix" button to fork someone else's song
- Voting/favorites

## Export/Integration

- JSON export with embeddable player for games (see PLAYER_PLAN.md)
- Import from Guitar Pro / Ultimate Guitar
- OGG/MP3 compressed audio export
- Tracker format export (MOD/XM)

## Mobile/Touch

- Better touch interface
- Gesture-based input
- PWA for offline use
